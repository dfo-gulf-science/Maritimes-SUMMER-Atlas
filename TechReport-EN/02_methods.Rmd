# Methods
## Survey Description
The survey is conducted annually in July-August and covers the Scotian Shelf and the Bay of Fundy (Figure \@ref(fig:map1)). It normally involves at least two separate trips on board an offshore fisheries vessel from the Canadian Coast Guard for a total duration of around 6 weeks at sea.

The fishing platform used (the vessel and the type of fishing gear) has changed a number of times since the onset of sampling activities [@ClarkEmberley2011]. Comparative fishing experiments were conducted when those changes in survey platforms took place [@Koeller-Smith-1983;@Fanning-1984;@Fanning-1985;@Fowler-Showell-2009]. The A.T. Cameron using a Yankee 36 trawl was the primary survey vessel from 1970 to 1981. The vessel that was then built to replace the A.T. Cameron to conduct trawl surveys (CCGS Alfred Needler) was not yet operational, and the Lady Hammond was used to bridge the gap between the A.T. Cameron and the CCGS Alfred Needler. A change to the Western IIA trawl also took place after A.T. Cameron was retired. The CCGS Alfred Needler entered service for the 1983 summer survey using a Western IIA trawl. It has been the main survey platform since. The CCGS Alfred Needler suffered a fire in 2003 and the CCGS Teleost was used instead. In 2007, 2008 and 2018 the CCGS Alfred Needler was not available and the survey was conducted on the CCGS Teleost in 2007 and 2018, and on the CCGS Wilfred Templeman in 2008. The relevant details of the survey vessels [@Maginley-etal-2014] and fishing trawls [@Fanning-1985] used can be found in Table \@ref(tab:vesselandgear) and a timeline of the survey platforms can be found in Figure \@ref(fig:timeline).

In 2018, because of the unavailability of the CCGS Alfred Needler, only a partial survey coverage was achieved on CCGS Teleost, and most of the strata in NAFO Division 4VW were not sampled. As such, while the limited 2018 data are available, they are not used in the analyses present herein since estimates derived using the 2018 data will not be comparable to other years.

## Sampling Design
The summer survey covers divisions 4V, 4W and 4X of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO), which includes the Scotian Shelf and the Bay of Fundy. The eastern limit of the survey is the Laurentian Channel and the western limit is the Fundian Channel (Figure \@ref(fig:map1)).


The survey follows a stratified random design [@DoubledayRivard1981; @Lohr1999] (Figure \@ref(fig:map2)). The number of tows conducted in each stratum is approximately proportional to the surface area of the stratum. The targeted area covered by the survey has remained constant since its inception, with the exception of additional deeper strata that were sampled a few times since 2000. Because the sampling of the deeper strata is opportunistic and irregular, the analyses presented herein only include strata 440 to 495 which cover NAFO Divisions 4V, 4W and 4X (Figure \@ref(fig:map2) and Table \@ref(tab:tabstrata)). Strata 443, 444, 445 cover an area with mixed depths and are represented as a single polygon in Figure \@ref(fig:map2).

The basic sampling unit of the survey is a 30-minute fishing tow conducted at a speed of 3.5 knots. This yields a distance towed of 1.75 nautical miles.

After each tow the catch is sorted by species and weighed. Each fish caught is then measured, and further sampling of individual fish weight, maturity status and age are performed for different length classes. When catches exceed 300 individuals, a random sub-sample is used to obtain the length and weight measurements.


## Taxonomic Levels {#taxo}

Fish species caught during the surveys are identified by trained scientific personnel and their scientific name is determined. An internal species code used in the relational database is reported for each species [@LosierWaite1989]. There are a few instances where a number of species are assigned to a single species code (e.g. *Sebates* and *Myctophidae* species).

By its nature as a bottom trawl, the fishing gear used in the survey catches certain species better than others. To ensure that meaningful ecological information can be extracted from catch samples, we report the catch records for the subset of species that are caught reliably by the gear. To appear in this atlas, a species must have been observed a minimum of 10 times over the duration of the survey activities. While both catch abundance and weight are recorded, the weight of species that appear at low abundances is often recorded as zero in the earlier parts of the survey when scales of appropriate precision were not available. Another important factor to consider when analyzing weights is the change from spring scales to electronic balances that occurred in the 1990s. This change will affect the error structure of weight observations but should not introduce a bias in the measurements.

We divided the species caught into five categories based on 1) their taxonomic classification, 2) the number of recorded observations (i.e. the number of sets were a species was recorded), and 3) their period of valid identification (Table \@ref(tab:taxocat)). Category ‚ÄùLF‚Äù, for ‚Äùlong frequent‚Äù, was assigned to species that have been caught in more than 1000 sets since 1970 and have been consistently identified since the onset of the survey. Category ‚ÄùLI‚Äù, for ‚Äùlong intermediate‚Äù, was assigned to species that were caught in 1000 to 200 sets. Rare and elusive species (those caught in less than 200 sets over the duration of the survey) are also reported but to a lower level of analytical details (Category ‚ÄùLR‚Äù, for ‚Äùlong rare‚Äù). Category ‚ÄùSF‚Äù, for ‚Äùshort frequent‚Äù, was assigned to invertebrate species that were consistently sampled only since 1999 [@Tremblayetal:2007]. And category ‚ÄùSR‚Äù, for ‚Äùshort rare‚Äù for invertebrate species consistently sampled only since 1999 and caught in less than 200 sets.

## Analyses

The Oracle relational database where all survey data are stored and archived is accessible from the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. Queries written in Structured Query Language (SQL) are used to extract the data from the production server and to create the data products used in all subsequent analyses. Catch records classified as ‚Äùvalid‚Äù (i.e. coming from a representative tow without damage to the net, and coded as ‚Äùtype=1‚Äù in the Oracle database) are used in the current analyses. To make the available samples comparable, catch weight for each species was standardized for the distance towed. The results of the different comparative fishing experiments [@Koeller-Smith-1983;@Fanning-1984;@Fowler-Showell-2009] show that the different fishing platforms have comparable fishing efficiency and no further correction factors are used in the present analyses.

All data processing and analyses were conducted using the R software [@R:2021] using packages gstat [@R:package:gstat], PBSmapping [@R:package:PBSmapping], RODBC [@R:package:RODBC], spatstat [@R:package:spatstat],  maptools [@R:package:maptools], rgeos [@R:package:rgeos], classInt [@R:package:classInt], RColorBrewer [@R:package:RColorBrewer], MASS [@R:package:MASS], worms [@R:package:worms], and tidyverse [@R:Tidyverse]. The present document is rendered as a Technical Report using the csasdown R package developed and maintained by Fisheries and Oceans Canada scientists [@R:csasdown].

### Geographic distribution of catches

Spatial interpolation of catch biomass (kg/tow) was done using a weighting inversely proportional to the distance (inverse-distance weighted, IDW), using function ‚Äùidw‚Äù of the spatstat R package [@R:package:spatstat]. To achieve a visually appropriate rendition of the available catch data, the IDW method uses a power parameter value of 10. The IDW predictions are over a fixed grid with a resolution of 200 by 200 on the bounding box of the georeferenced survey data. 



### Biomass indices

For each species, stratified random estimates of catch biomass and abundance [@Smith:1996] were computed for each year. Yearly estimates of the standard error were also computed. In years where some strata were not sampled, the stratified estimate is calculated ignoring the missed strata. This implicitly assumes that the captures in the missed strata were the same as the overall mean. If a species does not follow this assumption in the missed strata the estimate will be biased. As such, the values presented herein should be treated with further analytical detail to ascertain that the estimate is unbiased.



### Distribution indices

For each Category L, I and S fish species, the minimum area required to account for 75% and 95% of the total biomass were computed (D75% and D95%). These measures of distributions were computed for each year by using the Lorenz curve of mean stratum-level catch estimates and the area of occupied strata [@Swain:Sinclair:1994:cjfas; @Swain:Morin:1996:cjfas].


### Length frequencies

The length frequency distribution of catch (the stratified numbers-at-length) is tabulated for each seven-year period (1970-2009), and last ten-year period (2010-2020).


### Length-weight relationship and condition factor

The relationship between the weight and the length of fish was estimated using the following non-linear allometric relationship:

\begin{eqnarray*}\label{eqLengthWeight}
W = \alpha L ^\beta  
\\
\end{eqnarray*}

where W is the total weight (g), L is the length (cm), and, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the parameters to be estimated. 

Relative fish condition (C) [@lecren1951] was computed as:

\begin{eqnarray*}\label{eqCondition}
C = \frac{W}{\alpha L ^\beta}  
\\
\end{eqnarray*}




### Depth, temperature and salinity distribution of catches

For each category L species, we followed the methods developed by [@Perry:Smith:1994:cjfas] and generated cumulative frequency distributions of depth, temperature and salinity of survey catches. These cumulative frequency distributions can be compared to those obtained when using all survey sets in order to identify depth, temperature and salinity associations for the different species captured in the survey.

### Density-dependent habitat selection

We followed the methods of [@Myers:Stokes:1989] to evaluate how fish abundance in each stratum varied with overall temporal fluctuations of population abundance.

For each category L species, we fitted a model of the relationship between stratum-level density and overall abundance (the yearly stratified random estimate of abundance, defined above). To properly use the observations of zero catch while accounting for the logarithmic distribution of catch abundance, we implemented a generalized linear model using a log link and a Poisson error distribution:

\begin{eqnarray*}\label{eqHabitat Selection}
Y_{h,i} = \alpha_{h} Y_{i}^{\beta_h}
\\
\end{eqnarray*}

where, $Y_{h,i}$ is the average abundance of stratum $h$ in year $i$, and $\alpha_{h}$ and  $\beta_{h}$ are the fitted parameters. The estimated parameter $\beta_{h}$ is referred to as the "slope parameter" and indicates whether stratum-level density is positively ($\beta_{h} <= 0$), negatively ($\beta_{h} >= 0$) or negligibly ($\beta_{h} \approx 0$) related to population abundance.

To estimate the suitability of each stratum, the median abundance observed during the years that are in the top 25% of yearly estimates is used. We combine the slope parameter estimates from the above model with the median abundance to identify strata that have consistently high abundance and whose local density is weakly related to fluctuation in population abundance ($\beta_{h,i} \approx 0$). Preferred strata are identified for each category L species.

## Description of Figures
The figures generated for each species are presented in the Appendix and consist of up to six figures (Figure types A to F) per species, depending on their taxonomic level classification (as described in Section \@ref(sec:taxo) above). The figure types are used as a suffix in each figure number.

### Type A
For Category L and S species: 

Spatial distribution of catch-per unit of effort, (CPUE, kilograms per tow) in July-August for the Bay of Fundy and Scotian Shelf in five-year periods. Spatial interpolation between tows was done using Inverse Distance Weight (IDW). The probability of occurrence ($P(occ)$, the proportion of tows with catch records for a given species) was also reported for each five-year period.

For Category LR and SR:

Location of tows with catch over the period 1970-2020 (Type LR) or the period 1999-2020 (Type SR).

### Type B
For Category L, S and I species:

Stratified random estimate of CPUE (left panel), distribution indices (D75% and D95%, the minimum area containing 75% and 95% of biomass, middle panel), and distribution vs. weight per tow (right panel). The stratified random mean is plotted as a solid line with the 95% confidence region indicated by the solid grey line. The overall mean is plotted as a grey horizontal line and the overall mean plus or minus 50% of the standard deviation appear as horizontal dashed lines. In all three panels, the early years appear in blue and the last years appear in red. The predictions from a loess estimator are overlaid on the distribution indices (middle panel). The Pearson correlation coefficient between D75% and biomass, and its statistical significance, are also reported in the right panel.

### Type C.
For Category LF species:

Length frequency distribution for NAFO divisions 4X and 4VW. A smoothed length frequency distribution is shown for each 7-year periods covered by the surveys.

### Type D.
For Category LF species:

Average fish condition for all fish lengths (black dots and black line), large fish (thick gray line), and small fish (thin gray line). Fish condition is presented for NAFO divisions 4VW (right panel) and 4X (left panel).

### Type E.
For Category LF species:

Cumulative frequency distributions of depth, temperature and salinity at all sampled locations (thick solid line) and at fishing locations with catch records (thin dashed line). The depth, temperature and salinity associated with 5%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 95% of the cumulative catch is shown in tabular fashion on the bottom right panel.

### Type F.
For Category LF species:

Slopes estimates from the density-dependent habitat selection model (y axis) plotted versus the median abundance during the top 25% of years. The red box indicates strata of particular importance for a species by identifying slopes that are within a standard error from zero and that are within the top 25% of median abundance. Each stratum is identified on the plot by the last two digits of its number.
